Hello! Welcome to the Scala Skeleton REPO.

For the first project, you should only use code in the parser directory. When it comes time to work on the semantic
checker, you'll find we have symlinked in the files generated by Antlr into the main src directory. Enjoy!

For your convience I've copied the parser and scanner tests into the parser directory along with a test.sh that
evaluates your parser against our tests.
